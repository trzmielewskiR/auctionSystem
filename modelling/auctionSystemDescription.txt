Auction service

The database stores information about the users of the auction system. 
Each user is identified by a login, and also has mandatory attributes: name, home address, e-mail address, and 
optional: account number, delivery address, telephone. 
Users can, using the system, auction items. 
Each item is given an individual number, and must have a name, category, starting price. 
A description of the item and the purchase price are optional.
Each item is listed by one user.
When an item is listed, an auction is created. 
For each auction, we remember its unique id, start and end date, and status (in progress, finished buying, finished without buying). 
The item must be associated with at least one auction (but can be auctioned multiple times); 
each auction is for one item. 
Bids may be placed as part of an auction. 
The date and time of each bid within the auction and the amount are remembered.
Each bid is placed by one user. 
A user can make multiple bids within an auction. 
In the database, we want to remember the possible winner of the auction who buys the item. 
In addition, delivery options are associated with each auctioned item.
The database stores a list of possible delivery options, each described by a unique id, name, delivery company, and price. 
Each item must have at least one delivery option associated with it. 
Each delivery option can be associated with multiple items.
